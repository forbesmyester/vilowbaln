# VIsual LO(W)ad BALaNcer

In a microservices environment, when side effects are mocked out it should be possible to run whole back end systems in the browser for development.

If we can visualize a load balancer / queue it may make development / debugging easier as we'll be able to visually see the messages flying around.

This project is to mock a central HTTP router to enable that to happen.
